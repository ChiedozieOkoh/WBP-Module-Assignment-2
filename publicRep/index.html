            As we approached a new year, a catastrophic threat struck humanity which majorly affected our society.
            With the arrival of a new virus called Corona; many lives were lost; businesses went bankrupt and many people lost their jobs all
            while it substantially caused the economy to fall. Though much time has passed since the peak of Corona, there still has not been an end
            put to the pandemic. The whole world has been trying to find ways of controlling the spread, and therefore terminating the virus, however,
            not very successful.

            The world needs your help in order to eliminate this virus - therefore, we ask you to participate in the four-week programme.
            In this pilot, we will test and provide you with weekly check-ups, record all the information that
            we can and use this data for further research which will
            benefit developing a cure. This process is almost essential as it may boost the research time and help find a cure for the virus
            a lot sooner. You could save many lives, be a hero.
